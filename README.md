# HazardHulen.IO

## The software ##

HazardHulen.io is a multiplayer blackjack table, where players can bet virtual
currency to participate in a round of blackjack. The game uses the same ruleset as
regular blackjack played in casinos, with a few details left out for simplicity.
Players play against an artificial intelligence which acts as the dealer, and win
double their bet if they beat the AI. If a player loses, his bet is lost.
All players get a set amount of virtual money when they join the table, and have
to place a bet of at least a minimum amount to play. If a player does not place
a bet within a certain time period in between rounds, he is labeled as inactive,
and cannot take part in the next round.
